# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-23 after v1.2 milestone start)

**Core value:** Anyone can run a thorough codebase audit on any local folder without CLI setup — just open the app, pick a folder, and run.
**Current focus:** Phase 10 — tool-use-infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 11
Plan: Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0 (v1.2)
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 09-phase-0-enhancement P01 | 3 | 2 tasks | 5 files |
| Phase 09-phase-0-enhancement P02 | 8 | 1 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 10-tool-use-infrastructure P01 | 2 | 2 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.2 start]: Replace hardcoded JS/TS shell commands with LLM tool-use — LLM generates and executes commands per detected stack
- [v1.2 start]: Same AuditFindings JSON schema preserved — UI, results pages, and reports are entirely unchanged
- [v1.2 start]: execCommand tool must be sandboxed (read-only, no network, timeout enforced) — safety model intact
- [v1.2 start]: Per-phase guide chunks remain the approach — RepoContext is added to the prompt, guide section is not expanded
- [Phase 09-01]: RepoContext type lives in audit-engine (not db) to avoid circular dependency; DB column is untyped JSON cast at read time
- [Phase 09-01]: Dual getRepoContext/getRepoContextObject API preserves backward compat for all existing phase runners (1-9)
- [Phase 09-01]: All Zod RepoContext fields are required (no .optional()) matching OpenAI structured output constraint
- [Phase 09-02]: Labeled command output pattern: [category:key] prefix per command enables deterministic LLM extraction into locByLanguage without ambiguity
- [Phase 09-02]: usage.totalTokens now passed to markPhaseCompleted for correct Phase 0 cost tracking (was 0 before)
- [Phase 10-01]: Vercel AI SDK v6 tool() uses inputSchema (not parameters) — discovered from type definitions, fixed at task time
- [Phase 10-01]: Sandboxed exec-command tool uses allowlist + blocklist + bash -c inspection — LLM gets '(blocked: reason)' string on rejection, not exception
- [Phase 10-01]: stepCountIs(15) cap on tool-use rounds balances thorough auditing with bounded cost

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9 must complete and persist RepoContext before any phase runner work begins — all of phases 10-11 depend on the schema being stable.
