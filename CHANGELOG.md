## 2026-03-22 — Design Overhaul Phase 1 & 2: Foundation & UI Primitives

### Added

- **CSS design tokens**: Full dark/light theme color system matching design prototype (accent yellow, surface/elevated layers, severity colors)
- **Keyframe animations**: `fadeIn`, `slideIn`, `progressPulse`, `shimmer` with staggered delay utility classes
- **JetBrains Mono font**: Added via `next/font/google` as `--font-jetbrains-mono` CSS variable
- **`SelectCard` component**: Reusable selection card with accent border, subtle bg, and box-shadow glow on selected state
- **`HealthScore` component**: SVG ring gauge with score/grade display, color-coded by threshold (green >70, yellow >40, red <40), sm/lg sizes
- **`primary` button variant**: Yellow accent bg with dark text, hover brightness lift

### Changed

- **CSS variables rewritten**: Mapped all Shadcn HSL variables to CodeAudit design tokens; `--primary`/`--accent` now map to yellow accent color; `--radius` set to 14px
- **Button component**: All variants now use `rounded-[10px]`, `transition-all duration-150`, `hover:-translate-y-[1px]`; destructive variant switched to subtle red bg/border style
- **Input component**: Updated to elevated bg, accent border on focus, `rounded-[10px]`, added `mono` prop for JetBrains Mono
- **Select trigger**: Matches input styling — elevated bg, accent focus, 10px radius
- **Alert dialog**: Content uses surface bg, 18px radius, border from design tokens; overlay already had backdrop blur
- **Severity badge**: Uses exact hex severity colors as inline styles for bg (10% opacity) and border (20% opacity)
- **Severity chart**: Tooltip uses surface bg with enhanced shadow

## 2026-03-22 — Replace LLM-Generated HTML Reports with Local Templates

### Changed

- **Phase 11 rewritten**: HTML report generation now uses deterministic local templates instead of LLM `generateText` calls
- **New file `report-templates.ts`**: Two exported functions (`generateManagementReport`, `generateTechnicalReport`) produce self-contained HTML via template literals
- **Removed `ai` / `generateText` dependency** from phase-11.ts — zero LLM tokens consumed for report generation
- **Dark theme by default** (#0d1117) with light theme toggle, inspired by reference report designs
- **Management report**: health score ring, severity pills + table, finding cards with severity borders, summary section
- **Technical report**: score badge, severity stat grid, all findings as expandable `<details>` cards grouped by severity, remediation priority list
- Both reports handle edge cases: empty findings, missing fields, zero scores

## 2026-03-22 — UI Polish: 6 Feedback Issues

### Fixed

- **Selected buttons indistinguishable**: Provider, audit-type, depth, and filter buttons now use solid white background with ring highlight when selected
- **No light theme toggle**: Added light/dark theme toggle in sidebar with localStorage persistence; removed forced dark mode from root layout; added proper light mode CSS variables
- **Display name "CodeAudit" missing "AI"**: Updated metadata title, sidebar logo, and setup wizard to say "CodeAudit AI"
- **Folder picker browse button useless**: Removed the broken `<input type="file" webkitdirectory>` and Browse button; kept only the text input for pasting absolute paths
- **Design too minimalistic**: Added visible borders (`border-zinc-300`/`border-zinc-700`), shadow on cards, solid button backgrounds, hover states (`hover:bg-zinc-100`/`hover:bg-zinc-800`), focus rings, and clear active states across all components

### Changed

- CSS variables restructured: light mode is now `:root` default, dark mode under `.dark` class
- Button variants updated: outline/secondary have visible borders, ghost has proper hover bg
- Input and select components have stronger border contrast

## 2026-03-22 — Improved HTML Report Design

### Changed

- **Phase-11 HTML report prompts** now include a full design system extracted from reference templates
- Management report uses sidebar layout, health score ring (SVG), traffic light tables, risk cards, stat cards, and action items
- Technical report uses expandable finding cards grouped by severity, score grids with progress bars, alert boxes, and remediation lists
- Both reports support dark/light theme toggle, responsive layout, and print styles
- Increased maxOutputTokens from 8192 to 16384 for richer report generation

## 2026-03-22 — Onboarding Welcome Screen

### Added

- **Onboarding welcome/about screen** as Step 1 of the setup wizard before API key entry
- Feature highlights: 13-phase audit, multi-provider support, live cost tracking, audit comparison
- Step indicator dots showing progress through the setup flow
- "Get Started" button to transition from welcome screen to API key setup

---

## 2026-03-22 — v1.0 CodeAudit MVP

### Added

**Phase 1: App Shell & Configuration**
- Local-first app architecture — runs at localhost, no cloud, no auth
- `npx codeaudit-ai` CLI launcher with auto-generated ENCRYPTION_KEY
- SQLite database at `~/.codeaudit-ai/codeaudit.db` (zero-config, no Docker needed)
- API key management with AES-256-GCM encryption, multiple keys per provider with labels
- API key validation via test API call on entry (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini)
- Multi-folder picker with path input and per-path validation
- Safety enforcement: `chmod -R a-w` + git push block with guaranteed unlock
- Non-git folder support (skip git-specific phases with user confirmation)
- First-time setup wizard (add API key → done)
- Audit type selection (full, security-only, team, code quality) with card UI
- Audit depth toggle (quick scan / deep audit) with time + cost details
- Model selector fetching available models dynamically from provider API
- Auto mode (cost-optimized model selection per phase)
- Live cost estimate updating as configuration changes
- Confirmation dialog summarizing audit before start
- Dark mode UI with Linear aesthetic, left sidebar navigation

**Phase 2: Audit Engine**
- LLM adapter for Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini via Vercel AI SDK 6
- AUTO model selection with 3 complexity tiers (simple/medium/complex)
- Audit orchestrator with cancel polling, phase checkpointing, and guaranteed folder cleanup
- Prompt builder with per-phase guide chunks (not full 93K guide per call)
- `<data_block trust="untrusted">` prompt injection defense
- Structured finding extraction via Zod schemas
- Phase 0 bootstrap: 14 detection commands + LLM context synthesis
- Phases 1-9: shell commands → LLM analysis → structured findings
- Phase 10: final report aggregation with scoring and grading
- Phase 11: HTML dashboard generation (management + technical)
- Audit type filtering (run only relevant phases per type)
- Quick scan depth mode (sampling, reduced grep output)
- SSE progress streaming polling SQLite every 500ms with state replay on reconnect
- Expandable per-phase detail view (status, findings count, duration, token cost)
- Cancel endpoint + resume from checkpoint support
- Budget warning when cost exceeds estimate by >20%
- All output to audit directory, never inside target folder

**Phase 3: Results & Cost**
- Findings dashboard with health score, letter grade (A-F), and severity breakdown chart (Recharts)
- Filterable/sortable findings list by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info)
- Finding cards with severity badge, file path, line number, evidence snippet, collapsible remediation
- Separate executive and technical report pages (iframe-embedded Phase 11 HTML)
- Cost summary banner (total tokens + cost) with per-phase breakdown table
- Budget overrun warning (yellow banner when >20% over estimate)
- Partial results support for cancelled/failed audits
- "View Results" transition from progress view on completion
- Zip download of all audit artifacts (HTML, markdown, JSON, all files)
- PDF generation via Puppeteer from HTML dashboards
- Raw HTML report serve for iframe embedding

**Phase 4: History & Comparison**
- Audit history page grouped by folder path with score/grade badges
- Per-audit row with date, type, depth, and health score
- Click any audit to view its full results dashboard
- "Compare latest two" button for folders with 2+ audits
- Delta comparison page with score delta banner (colored +/-)
- Side-by-side severity charts (previous vs latest)
- Three-section finding diff: new (red), resolved (green), persisted (gray)
- Set-based finding matching by title + file path

### Changed
- **Architecture pivot**: Switched from cloud webapp (GitHub OAuth, PostgreSQL, BullMQ) to local-first (no auth, SQLite, in-process execution)
- Stripped all GitHub OAuth, Auth.js, GitHub App webhook code from Phase 1 scaffold

### Fixed
- Argument order bug in settings page `createApiKey` call (label/key swap)
- Missing `actualCostMicrodollars` computation in `markPhaseCompleted`
- Import typo `findRunPhaseLlm` → `runPhaseLlm` in phase-00 runner
- Undefined `result.score` variable in phase-10 runner
