# Requirements: CodeAudit AI v1.1

**Defined:** 2026-03-22
**Core Value:** Anyone can run a thorough codebase audit on any local folder without CLI setup — just open the app, pick a folder, and run.

## v1.1 Requirements

Complete UI redesign — delete all existing page/component/layout code and rebuild from scratch using new design system. Backend (server actions, API routes, DB, audit engine) stays intact.

### Design System (DSYS)

- [x] **DSYS-01**: App uses dark theme by default with design tokens (#0a0a0b bg, #111113 surface, #facc15 accent, full token set from guide)
- [x] **DSYS-02**: App supports light theme with correct token mapping (#fafafa bg, #ffffff surface, #ca8a04 accent)
- [ ] **DSYS-03**: User can toggle between dark/light themes (persisted preference)
- [x] **DSYS-04**: Tailwind CSS 4 config uses design tokens as CSS variables for both themes
- [x] **DSYS-05**: Geist (sans) and JetBrains Mono (mono) fonts are loaded and applied globally
- [x] **DSYS-06**: Animations work: fadeIn, slideIn, progressPulse, spin, stagger-1 through stagger-5

### Shared Components (COMP)

- [x] **COMP-01**: Badge component with color prop, pill shape, 11px text, colored border+bg

## v2 Requirements

### Deferred from Active

- **DIST-01**: npm global install / Homebrew distribution
- **METR-01**: Model accuracy/quality metrics display

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Backend changes | v1.1 is frontend-only; server actions, API routes, DB, audit engine stay as-is |
| New functionality | No new features — same capabilities, new skin |
| Mobile responsive | Desktop browser only per v1.0 constraint |
| i18n / localization | English only |
