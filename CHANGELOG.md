All notable changes to CodeAudit will be documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-08 — Deterministic Scoring Methodology

### Changed
- **Scoring formula**: Replaced opaque LLM-based scoring with deterministic severity-weighted deduction formula inspired by [Contrast Security](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/application-scoring-guide.html) (Critical −20, High −10, Medium −5, Low −1, Info 0)
- **Grade thresholds**: Adjusted to A ≥90, B ≥75, C ≥60, D ≥40, F <40 (previously A ≥90, B ≥80, C ≥70, D ≥60)
- LLM demoted to executive summary generation only — no longer influences the health score

### Added
- **Scoring methodology explainer** on results dashboard — collapsible panel showing formula, per-severity deduction breakdown for the audit, grade thresholds, and Contrast Security attribution

### Fixed
- **Score scale bug**: LLM returned 0–10 score used directly as 0–100, producing absurdly low scores (e.g., 5/100 for a codebase that should score ~49)

### Fixed (pre-release hardening)
- **Stream handler**: SSE stream now catches DB errors and emits an error event to the client instead of silently closing.
- **Phase timeout**: Each audit phase now has a 30-minute hard timeout — hangs no longer block the orchestrator indefinitely.
- **Rate limit retry**: LLM calls retry up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff (2s and 4s waits between attempts) on rate-limit responses (HTTP 429, "Too Many Requests", or Gemini RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED).
- **Finding-extractor**: `runPhaseLlm` now wraps `generateObject` errors with phase context and preserves the original error via `Error.cause` for clearer diagnostics.
- **Version sync**: CLI package and VERSION file now correctly reflect v0.6.1.

### Added (pre-release hardening)
- Platform support table in README (macOS/Linux supported, Windows native not supported — use WSL2).
- Troubleshooting section in README covering 6 common failure scenarios.
- Unit tests for `withRetry` rate-limit retry behavior (5 cases).
- Integration tests for the orchestrator's cancel flag, checkpoint resume, non-fatal phase failure, and folder unlock guarantee (5 cases).
- Unit tests for `runPhaseLlm` error wrapping and Error.cause preservation (3 cases).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-07 — OpenAI-Compatible Provider Support

### Added
- **OpenAI-compatible provider** — connect any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp, etc.) with custom base URL
- Model discovery for custom endpoints via `/v1/models` API
- API key management UI supports base URL field for openai-compatible provider
- Cost estimation defaults for openai-compatible provider (zero-cost for local models)
- Pricing entry for openai-compatible in `pricing.json`

### Changed
- Provider type extended to `"anthropic" | "openai" | "gemini" | "openai-compatible"` across all packages
- AUTO mode disabled for openai-compatible provider (requires explicit model selection)
- API key validation skipped for openai-compatible (custom auth schemes vary)

### Fixed
- `phase-10.ts`: `result` variable used outside `try` block scope — hoisted token counters
- `phase-11.ts`: `markPhaseCompleted` called with 5 args instead of required 6
- `tool-phase-runner.ts`: `inputTokensTotal`/`outputTokensTotal` referenced before declaration
- `progress-emitter.ts`: pricing.json type cast failed due to metadata fields (`_comment`, `_updated`)
- `schema.ts`: Drizzle `.default(null)` not valid for text columns

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-XX — Production Foundation

### Added
- CLI packaging with tsup — `npx codeaudit-ai` now works on clean machines
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline (lint, typecheck, test, build) on Node 20/22
- Symlink escape detection in command execution sandbox
- Accurate cost tracking using real token counts from AI SDK (replaces 75/25 estimate)
- Pricing config file (`pricing.json`) for per-release price updates
- Test suite for exec-command-tool (allowlist, patterns, path containment, symlinks)
- Test suite for tool-phase-runner (JSON repair, schema validation, finding rescue)
- Test suite for prompt-builder (injection boundary verification)
- Test suite for finding-extractor (Zod schema validation)
- Test suite for cost calculation (per-provider accuracy)
- VERSION file for release tracking

### Removed
- Dead `worker/` package (BullMQ stub — not needed for v1)
- Dead `packages/repo-sandbox/` (placeholder — not needed for v1)
- Docker Compose for PostgreSQL/Redis (app uses SQLite only)
- Stale .env.example references to DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, AUTH_SECRET, GitHub OAuth

### Fixed
- CLI bin path pointing to nonexistent `./src/index.ts` (now compiled to `./dist/index.js`)
- Cost tracking off by up to 50% due to hardcoded 75/25 input/output token split
- Symlink inside audited repo could read files outside repository boundary

---

## 2026-03-22 — Design Overhaul Phase 1 & 2: Foundation & UI Primitives

### Added

- **CSS design tokens**: Full dark/light theme color system matching design prototype (accent yellow, surface/elevated layers, severity colors)

## 2026-03-22 — Replace LLM-Generated HTML Reports with Local Templates

### Changed

- **Phase 11 rewritten**: HTML report generation now uses deterministic local templates instead of LLM `generateText` calls
- **New file `report-templates.ts`**: Two exported functions (`generateManagementReport`, `generateTechnicalReport`) produce self-contained HTML via template literals
- **Removed `ai` / `generateText` dependency** from phase-11.ts — zero LLM tokens consumed for report generation
- **Dark theme by default** (#0d1117) with light theme toggle, inspired by reference report designs
- **Management report**: health score ring, severity pills + table, finding cards with severity borders, summary section
- **Technical report**: score badge, severity stat grid, all findings as expandable `<details>` cards grouped by severity, remediation priority list
- Both reports handle edge cases: empty findings, missing fields, zero scores

---

## 2026-03-22 — UI Polish: 6 Feedback Issues

### Fixed

- **Selected buttons indistinguishable**: Provider, audit-type, depth, and filter buttons now use solid white background with ring highlight when selected
- **No light theme toggle**: Added light/dark theme toggle in sidebar with localStorage persistence; removed forced dark mode from root layout; added proper light mode CSS variables
- **Display name "CodeAudit" missing "AI"**: Updated metadata title, sidebar logo, and setup wizard to say "CodeAudit AI"
- **Folder picker browse button useless**: Removed the broken `<input type="file" webkitdirectory>` and Browse button; kept only the text input for pasting absolute paths
- **Design too minimalistic**: Added visible borders (`border-zinc-300`/`border-zinc-700`), shadow on cards, solid button backgrounds, hover states (`hover:bg-zinc-100`/`hover:bg-zinc-800`), focus rings, and clear active states across all components

### Changed

- CSS variables restructured: light mode is now `:root` default, dark mode under `.dark` class
- Button variants updated: outline/secondary have visible borders, ghost has proper hover bg
- Input and select components have stronger border contrast

---

## 2026-03-22 — Improved HTML Report Design

### Changed

- **Phase-11 HTML report prompts** now include a full design system extracted from reference templates
- Management report uses sidebar layout, health score ring (SVG), traffic light tables, risk cards, stat cards, and action items
- Technical report uses expandable finding cards grouped by severity, score grids with progress bars, alert boxes, and remediation lists
- Both reports support dark/light theme toggle, responsive layout, and print styles
- Increased maxOutputTokens from 8192 to 16384 for richer report generation

---

## 2026-03-22 — Onboarding Welcome Screen

### Added

- **Onboarding welcome/about screen** as Step 1 of the setup wizard before API key entry
- Feature highlights: 13-phase audit, multi-provider support, live cost tracking, audit comparison
- Step indicator dots showing progress through the setup flow
- "Get Started" button to transition from welcome screen to API key setup
