# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-22 after v1.1 milestone start)

**Core value:** Anyone can run a thorough codebase audit on any local folder without CLI setup — just open the app, pick a folder, and run.
**Current focus:** Phase 05 — foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 6
Plan: Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0 (v1.1)
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 05-foundation P01 | 3 | 2 tasks | 56 files |
| Phase 05-foundation P02 | 8 | 2 tasks | 8 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.1 start]: Complete frontend rebuild — zero old component/layout code reused. Backend (server actions, API routes, DB, audit engine) stays intact.
- [v1.1 start]: Design references are docs/UI_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md and docs/codeaudit-ai.jsx mockup — these are the source of truth for visual output.
- [Phase 04-history-comparison]: Findings diff uses Set-based matching with composite key (title + filePath[0]) — O(n) lookup, handles multi-file findings correctly.
- [Phase 05-foundation]: Severity colors added to both :root and .dark selectors — were only in .dark, causing undefined values in light theme
- [Phase 05-foundation]: setup/actions.ts moved to actions/setup.ts before deleting setup dir to preserve completeSetup() server action
- [Phase 05-foundation]: Badge uses inline style for dynamic color; falls back to accent Tailwind classes
- [Phase 05-foundation]: Button uses cva pattern with Slot for asChild composition
- [Phase 05-foundation]: Modal uses simple div-based implementation (not Radix Dialog) per prototype spec

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 must fully delete old frontend code before any new component work begins — partial deletion causes CSS conflicts.
- Design tokens must be wired as CSS variables in Tailwind CSS 4 config before any component uses them.
