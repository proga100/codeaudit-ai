# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-22 after local-first pivot)

**Core value:** Anyone can run a thorough codebase audit on any local folder without CLI setup — just open the app, pick a folder, and run.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: -
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-foundation P01 | 8 | 3 tasks | 19 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pivot 2026-03-22]: Architecture changed from cloud webapp (GitHub OAuth) to local-first (localhost server, local folder selection). GitHub OAuth and GitHub App code from old Phase 1 is discarded.
- [Pivot 2026-03-22]: Reusable from old Phase 1 — Next.js scaffold, Drizzle ORM, dark mode UI, AES-256-GCM API key encryption, maskedKey pattern, microdollar integer cost storage, AuditFindings JSONB schema shape
- [Pivot 2026-03-22]: Safety model is filesystem-level: chmod -R a-w (read-only lock) + git remote set-url --push origin no_push (git push block) — enforced programmatically before audit starts
- [Pivot 2026-03-22]: All audit output goes to ~/audit-{repo-name}/ — never inside the target folder
- [Pivot 2026-03-22]: BYOK with Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini from day one — provider-tuned prompts required for audit phases
- [Phase 01-foundation]: SQLite (better-sqlite3) via Drizzle ORM replaces Neon+PostgreSQL — local file at ~/.codeaudit/codeaudit.db, WAL mode
- [Phase 01-foundation]: No-auth model: middleware is pass-through, setup_complete appSettings flag guards app routes
- [Phase 01-foundation]: CLI launcher auto-generates ENCRYPTION_KEY persisted to ~/.codeaudit/.env, spawns next dev, polls /api/health, then opens browser

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 (Audit Engine): Prompt engineering across 3 providers for 13 analytical phases is high-risk. Plan Phase 2 with a golden test repo evaluation approach before declaring engine complete.
- Phase 2: Prompt injection via repo file contents must be handled — wrap repo content in explicit DATA BLOCK framing in all LLM prompts.
