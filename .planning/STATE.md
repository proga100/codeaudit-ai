# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** Anyone can get a thorough, structured codebase health audit on their GitHub repos without CLI setup — just connect GitHub, pick a repo, and run.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Research recommends GitHub App (Contents: read per-repo) over OAuth App with `repo` scope — implement from the start to avoid OAuth overprivilege (Pitfall 6 in research)
- BYOK API keys must use AES-256-GCM application-layer encryption with master key in secrets manager — not just transparent DB encryption
- Structured findings JSON schema must be decided in Phase 1 even though comparison UI ships in Phase 5
- Object storage decision (local disk vs. S3) should be locked during Phase 1 schema design
- [Phase 01-foundation]: AuditFindings JSONB schema locked in Phase 1 schema.ts for stable Phase 5 comparison diff target
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Costs stored as microdollar integers (not floats) to avoid floating-point precision issues in token accounting
- [Phase 01-foundation]: apps/web excluded from root tsconfig project references — Next.js uses bundler moduleResolution incompatible with composite mode
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Database session strategy confirmed — GitHub access_token stays in accounts table server-side only, never in JWT or client cookie
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Server actions for auth sign-in/sign-out to avoid client-side token exposure
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Onboarding steps 2-3 are intentional placeholder UI — wired to real functionality in Plan 01-03
- [Phase 01-foundation]: maskedKey column added to api_keys schema — store last-4 chars of plaintext at creation, no decryption needed for list views
- [Phase 01-foundation]: API key validation allows rate_limited/quota_exceeded through to storage — key is valid even with usage limits
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Webhook installation.created: callback route owns DB record creation; webhook handler only logs

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (Audit Engine) has a research flag: prompt engineering across 3 providers for 13 analytical phases is high-risk. Plan Phase 3 with a golden test repo evaluation sprint before declaring engine complete.
- GitHub App vs. OAuth App decision resolved: GitHub App with `Contents: read` per-repo scope (D-04 in CONTEXT.md). Plans 01-02 and 01-03 implement this.
