# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-22 after v1.1 milestone start)

**Core value:** Anyone can run a thorough codebase audit on any local folder without CLI setup — just open the app, pick a folder, and run.
**Current focus:** Phase 08 — data-views

## Current Position

Phase: 08
Plan: Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0 (v1.1)
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.1 start]: Complete frontend rebuild — zero old component/layout code reused. Backend (server actions, API routes, DB, audit engine) stays intact.
- [v1.1 start]: Design references are docs/UI_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md and docs/codeaudit-ai.jsx mockup — these are the source of truth for visual output.
- [Phase 04-history-comparison]: Findings diff uses Set-based matching with composite key (title + filePath[0]) — O(n) lookup, handles multi-file findings correctly.
- [Phase 05-foundation]: Severity colors added to both :root and .dark selectors — were only in .dark, causing undefined values in light theme
- [Phase 05-foundation]: setup/actions.ts moved to actions/setup.ts before deleting setup dir to preserve completeSetup() server action
- [Phase 05-foundation]: Badge uses inline style for dynamic color; falls back to accent Tailwind classes
- [Phase 05-foundation]: Button uses cva pattern with Slot for asChild composition
- [Phase 05-foundation]: Modal uses simple div-based implementation (not Radix Dialog) per prototype spec
- [Phase 06-shell-onboarding]: ThemeToggle uses neutral bg-text/text-background colors (NOT accent) per DSYS-03 spec
- [Phase 06-shell-onboarding]: Setup page lives OUTSIDE (app) route group so it renders without sidebar — correct per SIDE-03
- [Phase 06-shell-onboarding]: Dashboard split: server page.tsx fetches+serializes data, client recent-audits-table.tsx handles interactivity
- [Phase 06-shell-onboarding]: Active nav state: exact match for /dashboard, prefix match for other routes to avoid false highlights
- [Phase 07-audit-flows]: PHASE_NAMES constant defined in client component — audit-engine is server-only, cannot be imported in client bundles
- [Phase 07-audit-flows]: SSE useEffect depends on [audit.id, status] — terminal status values prevent re-opening connections after audit ends
- [Phase 07-audit-flows]: NEXT_REDIRECT from startAudit detected in catch block — only real errors shown to user
- [Phase 07-audit-flows]: Native select with optgroup used for provider/key grouping (no extra dependencies, matches prototype)
- [Phase 08-data-views]: History page: SerializedAudit/FolderGroup types exported from page.tsx, router.refresh() for post-delete reload, optional chaining for TypeScript strict compliance
- [Phase 08-data-views]: Severity key narrowing: SEVERITY_KEYS tuple defined before SEVERITY_COLORS Record for type-safe lookup
- [Phase 08-data-views]: Phase cost estimate: proportional allocation (phase.tokensUsed * totalCostMicro / totalTokens) — approximation since LLM billing is per-call
- [Phase 08-data-views]: Comparison page determines prev/curr by comparing createdAt timestamps, not query param order
- [Phase 08-data-views]: API Keys delete has no confirmation modal — simpler UX, keys can be re-added if deleted accidentally

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 must fully delete old frontend code before any new component work begins — partial deletion causes CSS conflicts.
- Design tokens must be wired as CSS variables in Tailwind CSS 4 config before any component uses them.
